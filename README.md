# task
There are 3 methods:

1. Modify the array to get only the odded numbers.
2. Create files where you delete all the repeated numbers. The first file contains all the simple numbers from 1 to 1000.
   The second one contains all the "happy" numbers from 1 to 1000.
3. The game. The goal of that one is to find all letters of the one of the forty words from the array
   and try to do it in 6 attempts before you will lose.
